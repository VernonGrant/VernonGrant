# Vernon Grant

I'm a South African web developer currently based in Hong Kong. I'm a fast
learner and enjoy solving complex problems in simple ways. I also have a clear
perspective on what's important from a technological and business point of
view. Most importantly, I love programming! [Contact Me](mailto:vernon@ruppell.io)
