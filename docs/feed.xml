This energy can differ from day to day and from person to person. We as individuals can optimize our available energy levels by sleeping and eating well, and by also having a good exercise routine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We might be tempted to optimize certain aspects of our lives to help improve our energy levels. And we certainly should as long as we do so in a healthy manner. For example cutting out social media would be a healthy optimization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But a smarter approach is to just not spend the energy in the first place. This is where the incredibly important skill of prioritization comes in. Knowing what should and should not be done is a game changer. The fastest way to become productive is to not spend time on the things that doesn&#39;t really matter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you just focus on getting shit done, then all you&#39;ll get done is shit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.vernon-grant.com/enhanced-productivity-through-prioritization/</guid></item><item><title>Keeping a clear mind in an overly connected world</title><link>https://www.vernon-grant.com/keeping-a-clear-mind-in-an-overly-connected-world/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had a conversation with a person on the topic of nutrition and health. And within the first 10 seconds of the conversation a picture of Jordan Peterson entered my mind and about 5 seconds later the person uttered his name.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And it isn&#39;t the first time this has happened to me, it actually happens all the time. It&#39;s becoming more and more difficult to have conversations with people that doesn&#39;t revolve around some set of ideas that belong to a cluster of YouTube channels, podcasts and so on. It&#39;s almost as if I can tell what YouTube channels, podcasts a person is following by just initiating a conversation with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To find a person that genuinely has their own way of thinking or believes/ideas that they have grown from a ground level through their own thinking and judgements seems to be almost impossible. And don&#39;t mean original ideas, but more the fact that they actually thought about the information they might be sharing. I believe one of the reasons for this is the way we consume information today, there&#39;s no longer this deliberate method of finding information. We&#39;re being spoon-fed without us deliberately choosing what it is we might want or need to consume.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I read a book once, can&#39;t remember the name, but it touched on the subject of &lt;strong&gt;chauffeur knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;. And this concept definitely applies to the majority of people today. I think in a world so connected, where so much information is being mindlessly consumed, the outcome can&#39;t be different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is something that has effected me too and that I&#39;m now desperately trying fix. I&#39;ve been slowly chipping away at this for past couple months and I can honestly say that my mind is feeling a lot more clear, less cluttered and relaxed. It&#39;s been one of the best decisions I&#39;ve made. Here&#39;s some of the steps I took to help protect myself from the side effects of the connected world:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I no longer use any platforms that spoon-feeds me information without me curating the source. This is basically most platforms.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I&#39;ve completely stopped using social media for the most part. I did however make list of YouTube channels that I think are good sources of information. I&#39;ll check these channels for updates once or twice a week.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I started using RSS again to subscribe to blogs. I read an articles or two every other day.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I also started reading more books. This is also something I curate heavily as some modern books are nothing more then advertisements.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any fool can know. The point is to understand. â€” Albert Einstein&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;</description><pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.vernon-grant.com/keeping-a-clear-mind-in-an-overly-connected-world/</guid></item><item><title>I&#39;m cutting ties, hey NeoVim</title><link>https://www.vernon-grant.com/im-cutting-ties-hey-neovim/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vernon-grant.com/my-text-editor-predicament/&#34;&gt;My text editor predicament&lt;/a&gt;. The idea of cutting ties and not marring the tools I use, has been brewing for some time now. And so I&#39;ve decided to get my knife out to start cutting away at these unhealthy tool obsessions or tool doctrines that I&#39;ve developed over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As of today, &lt;a href=&#34;https://neovim.io/&#34;&gt;NeoVim&lt;/a&gt;  is what I&#39;m going to be using. And If something better comes along in the future, I&#39;ll switch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Initially I gave Intellj a solid try but after a couple weeks I just realized that I did not enjoy using it as much, and that I found that there&#39;s a little bit to much handholding for my liking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.vernon-grant.com/im-cutting-ties-hey-neovim/</guid></item><item><title>My text editor predicament</title><link>https://www.vernon-grant.com/my-text-editor-predicament/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The past 7-8 years I&#39;ve pretty much used every text editor under the sun certain amount of time. If I had to break it down in order of longest used, it would be: Emacs, Vim/NeoVim, Intellj, Sublime Text, Atom, VSCode and the list go&#39;s on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I started programming, my attitude towards editors were for the most part neutral. I was using my mouse to click and select things without a care in the world. I only used a couple shortcuts to find files or run commands, and the arrow keys were my best friends. It was was all very simple.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But then, Vim and Emacs entered the chat and my mindset started to change. Now a text editor became more than just a tool to edit text with. It was now something I could mold, configure and tweak to meet my needs. This might sound totally insane but Emacs became a part of my identity, I basically married that tool. I mastered all its default key bindings and even learned E-Lisp so I could write my own extensions. I&#39;m basically an Emacs master now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And as a result of this, I find it difficult to use other tools, I&#39;m kinda chained down, boxed in. Every tool has its own philosophy, but most follow generic norms. Emacs and Vim/NeoVim does not, their philosophies are distinct and vast. And so once you adopt one it becomes difficult to leave. That is why almost every editor today has support form Vim bindings, its there to cater to the people who accepted the Vim philosophy on doing things. But in that sense Vim/NeoVim users also very lucky to have such great support out there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for me, Emacs is even more niche. Most other tools can&#39;t emulate Emacs features such as the marks, kill ring, i-search, occur, bookmarks, dired... This leaves me in a predicament, do I stick with Emacs for the rest of my career or do I cut ties now and move on to something a little bit more generic, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&#34;&gt;Intellj&lt;/a&gt;  , the new kid on the block &lt;a href=&#34;https://zed.dev/&#34;&gt;Zed&lt;/a&gt; or maybe I just pick the middle ground with &lt;a href=&#34;https://neovim.io/&#34;&gt;NeoVim&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.vernon-grant.com/my-text-editor-predicament/</guid></item><item><title>Say, Hello World!</title><link>https://www.vernon-grant.com/say-hello-world/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&#39;m turning over a new leaf&lt;/strong&gt;, leaving some things in the past and getting serious about my career and life.
