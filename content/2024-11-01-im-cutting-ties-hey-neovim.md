title = "I'm cutting ties, hey NeoVim"
+++

Yesterday I wrote about [My text editor predicament](https://www.vernon-grant.com/my-text-editor-predicament/). The idea of cutting ties and not marring the tools I use, has been brewing for some time now. And so I've decided to get my knife out to start cutting away at these unhealthy tool obsessions or tool doctrines that I've developed over the years.

As of today, [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)  is what I'm going to be using. And If something better comes along in the future, I'll switch. 

Initially I gave Intellj a solid try but after a couple weeks I just realized that I did not enjoy using it as much, and that I found that there's a little bit to much handholding for my liking.
