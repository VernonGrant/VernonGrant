title = "I'm cutting ties, hey Intellj"
+++

Yesterday I wrote about [My text editor predicament](https://www.vernon-grant.com/my-text-editor-predicament/). The idea of cutting ties and not marring the tools I use has been brewing for some time now. And so I've decided to get my knife out to start cutting away at these unhealthy tool obsessions or tool doctrines that I've developed over the years.

As of today, [Intellj](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is what I'm going to be using. And If something better comes along in the future, I'll switch. I'm going to be using it as is, in its default nature. I'm not going to try and change it into Emacs or Vim.
