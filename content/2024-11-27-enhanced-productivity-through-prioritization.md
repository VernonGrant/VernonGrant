title = "Enhanced productivity through prioritization"

We start our day with a certain amount of physical and mental energy. This energy can differ from day to day and from person to person. We as individuals can optimize our available energy levels by sleeping and eating well, and by also having a good exercise routine.

We might be tempted to optimize certain aspects of our lives to help improve our energy levels. And we certainly should as long as we do so in a healthy manner. For example cutting out social media would be a healthy optimization.

But a smarter approach is to just not spend the energy in the first place. This is where the incredibly important skill of prioritization comes in. Knowing what should and should not be done is a game changer. The fastest way to become productive is to not spend time on the things that doesn't really matter.
